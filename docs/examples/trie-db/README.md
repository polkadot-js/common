# Trie-DB Examples

Here you will find a list of examples that takes you through the basics of creating a Patricia Trie, creating key/value pair branches, retrieving the value of a branch with its key, deleting branches, saving the root node hash to a variable and then later setting the root node hash to restore the trie to its previous state, duplicating the trie with a snapshot, showing the size of the trie and other node information, and emptying, closing, and dropping the trie.

## Running the examples

From within each folder run the following to install required dependencies and to execute the example:
```shell
yarn;
yarn start
```
